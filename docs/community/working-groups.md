# Working Groups

<!--- cSpell:ignore wg_virt  -->

OKD is governed by working groups as set out in the [OKD Working Group Charter](charter.md)

There is a primary working group, where all the main decisions are made regarding the project.

Where an area of the project needs more time or is of interest to a subset of the working group membership, then a sub-group will be formed for that specific area,

The current sub groups are:

- [Documentation working group](wg_docs/overview.md)<!--{target=_blank} comment for docusaurus compat-->
- [Code-Ready Containers on OKD working group](wg_crc/overview.md)<!--{target=_blank} comment for docusaurus compat-->
- [OKD virtualization working group](wg_virt/overview.md)<!--{target=_blank} comment for docusaurus compat-->

## OKD Primary Working Group

The OKD group meets virtually every other week.
